# CarND-Controls-PID
Drive a race car around a track using a PID controller.  
The program is written in C++.  This Project is from Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program.

## Basic Set-up
1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) is installed.  Two install scripts are included for MAC and Linux.  For Windows use [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) and following the Linux instructions.
3. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
4. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
5. Run the programs: Run `./pid`. Open [Term 2 Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) and run the corresponding page.
